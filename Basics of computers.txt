Basics of computers :

  Role of an Operating System :a) User Interface
                               b) Processor Management
                               c) Memory Management
                               d) File Management
                               e) Security & Access Management
                               f) Device Driver Management 
                               g) Interrupts Management

Central Processing Unit : CPU
       Single core
       Dual Core
       Quad Core
       Multi Core

Various Types of Languages :

1. Assembly Language : Low level lang. intended to communicate directly with the hardware
       Assembler : is a program that translates commands into machine code. They gather instructions from the assembly and translate it to a series of electrical signals
  components :
         1. Syntax : basic structure
         2. Label : a word, a symbol, which can be used a s a reference point to locate instructions
         3. Command : an order
         4. Operand : Data Manipulation
         5. Directive : instructions to change or perform action
         6. Macro : shortcut representation of a sequence of instructions
         7. Mnemonics : represents abbreviations of the action performed

Eg : MOV a, 10 -- registers 10 in a location a
     MOV 5, b 

     ADD a,b,c -- adds a with b and stores in c

2. Machine Language : Every character in the keyboard will have an ascii number and it always occupies 1 byte (8 bits, either '0' or a '1')
00000000 - stop the program
00000001 - switch on


3. Programming Languages :

	a) Procedural Lang : A sequence of instructions in an order
            C,C++
            Java
            Basic
            Pascal
        b) Function Programming Lang : More focus is on the output of a Mathematical calculation/evaluation
            Scala
            Erlang
            Python
            F#
            Elixir
         c) OOP Lang : 	Treats a program as a group of objects composed of data and program elements(attributes, and methods)
            C++
            Java
            C#
            Python
            Ruby
         d) Scripting Lang : automates repetitive tasks, manages the dynamic content
             PHP
             Java Script
             Perl
             Python
             Bash
             Node Js
         e) Logic Programming Lang : Instead of passing instructions as what to do, we express a series of facts and rules that will be interpreted by the system and gives out decisions
             Prolog
             Datalog
             Alma
             Absys
          f) Front End Lang : mostly used for supporting UI/UX(User Interface/User Experience),Images, Colors, Text, navigation
             Html/CSS
             Javascripts
             React Js
             Angular
          g) Back End Lang : Deals with storage and manipulation of data(server side software). No direct interaction with the user
              JavaScript
              PHP
              Java
              C#

Application Development Models :
   1. Desktop applications/windows applications 
   2. Client/Server applications (2 tier, 3 tier, n tier)
   3. Web Model application(browser enabled)
   4. Mobile applications (Xamarin)
