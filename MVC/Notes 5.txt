Routing :  a module responsible for mapping the incoming browser request to an action method o a controller

  Conventional :
    https://localhost/44336/ => search the routeconfig.cs for the pattern
    https://localhost/44336/home => particular controller
    https://localhost/44336/home/index/5

  Attribute based : define routes using [Route]
  - We have to enable attribute routing in routeconfig.cs

--Decorate with the [Route]

Advantages of attribute based routing
 1. It gives us more control. We can create hierarchical URL Pattern
 (students have courses, orders have products, departments have employees)
 2. Reduces the chance of error
 3. May decouple the controller and action name 
 4. Easy to map 2 routes pointing to same action 

RoutePrefix : is a common attribute placed on a controller, for all the action methods of a controller

--To override the RoutePrefix , use a "~  symbol along with a different route)

--Route Contraints : can be applied on different action methods 
 - int  - 32 bit integer
 - alpha - matches upper/lower alphabets
 - bool - 
 - datetime 
 - guid 
 - length - string with specified length
 - max, min, minlength, maxlength, long, range, regex

  
Filters : are frameworks attributes that allows some logical code on a particular action/result/exception
 - helps in performing certain functionalities (Caching, Logging, authentication, authorizing etc..) during before/after of action/result declaration/exception

Exceptions : Handling MVC exceptions are done in a larger scale
  - try catch finally block
  - Overriding OnException()
  - Using [HandleError] attribute  (built-in)
  - Setting up a global exception filter
  - Handle Application_Error() Event
  - Extending HandleError Attribute

Available types of filters in ASP.Net MVC

 1. Authentication Filter   --> IAuthenicationFilter
 2. Authorization           --> IAuthorizationFilter
 3. Action                         ""
 4. Result                         ""
 5. Exception                   IExceptionFilter
 
Built-in Filters of the above types
 ValidateInput
 Authorize
 HandleError
 OutPutCache

Apart from the built-in, we can also create custom filters
-A filter can be applied at 3 different Levels

 1. Global Level ( applicable to all controllers and action methods of the application)
 2. Controller Level (applicable to all action methods of that controller)
 3. ActionMethod Level (applicable to specific action methods)

HandleError attribute is a class that can handle any unhandled exceptions of the application depending upon where we use it
- We need to set the custom errors mode on in the web.config file to enable the [handleerror] attribute

Limitations of HandleError : We cannot log the error anywhere
 - We cannot handle exceptions raised outside the controller (invalid url)
- We cannot display errors specific to specific situation.

In order to overcome the above limitations, we need to go for custom handlers by creating custom exception filters

Steps  :

0. remove customerrors mode in web.config file
