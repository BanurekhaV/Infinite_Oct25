Repository Pattern : is a structural pattern that abstracts the data access, providing a centralized way to manage data operations

- It is an intermediary layer between an appln business logic and data storage
- Enhanced code maintainability, testability, flexibility making it easier to work with different data sources


Asynchronous Controllers: It is a normal 

 - return type is prefixed with async modifier - method returns data asynchronously
 - they are task based Task<ActionResult> that return a value


Deferred         vs                                     Immediate LINQ

Query is not executed at the point of decl/construction       executes at the time of construction/declaration itself
Projection operators - select,                                Use Aggregate functions and Element operators - 
      selectmany                                                  first,last,single,tolist,toarray, todictionary
Restriction operators - paginationoperators take,skip

It can reflect latest data                                  reflects data at the time of execution


HTML Helpers : are C# methods that are used to return HTML. Using the helpers we can render all HTML controls(image, textbox, anchor, button)

Types of HTML Helpers :
1. Inline Html helper : are used on a single view of the same page. They are created using @helper tag

Eg : @helper MyInlineHelper(string[] words)
{
   <ol>
    @foreach(string s in words)
{
    <li>@s</l1>
}
</ol>
}

2. Built in Helpers

2.1. Standard Html Helper : are used to render typical html elements

 Eg : @Html.Action()  -- to create link tags
      @Html.TextBox()
      @Html.BeginForm()  -- to start a form action

2.2 Strongly Typed Html Helper : These take lambda expressions with parameters and informs the helper which property of the model has to be used
 Eg : @Html.LabelFor(model=>model.ID)
       @Html.TextBoxFor();

2.3 Templated Html Helper : is used for data display and input. Generates Html automatically as per the model property and also for the complete model with just a single Tag. It has 2 types
    1. Display Template : @Html.Display(), @Html.DisplayFor()

       @Html.DisplayForModel()  //single tag for entire model

    2. Editor Template : @Html.Editor(), @html.EditorFor()
     
        @Html.EditorForModel();

 3. Custom Html Helper : Users Preferences in the views. These can be of 2 types
     1. Static Helpers
     2. Extension Helpers
