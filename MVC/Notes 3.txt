Repository Pattern : is a structural pattern that abstracts the data access, providing a centralized way to manage data operations

- It is an intermediary layer between an appln business logic and data storage
- Enhanced code maintainability, testability, flexibility making it easier to work with different data sources


Asynchronous Controllers: It is a normal 

 - return type is prefixed with async modifier - method returns data asynchronously
 - they are task based Task<ActionResult> that return a value


Deferred         vs                                     Immediate LINQ

Query is not executed at the point of decl/construction       executes at the time of construction/declaration itself
Projection operators - select,                                Use Aggregate functions and Element operators - 
      selectmany                                                  first,last,single,tolist,toarray, todictionary
Restriction operators - paginationoperators take,skip

It can reflect latest data                                  reflects data at the time of execution
