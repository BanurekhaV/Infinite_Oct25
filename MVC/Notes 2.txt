Action Selectors : NonAction - to indicate that an action method is non actionable and hence cannot be invoked, as it does not have an entry in the routing table

ActionName: a provision to map action names with different view name 

Custom Segment Routing : we can change the url routing, and also have many map routes(the first being taken as the default)

Passing Information/Data from the controller to the view
----------------------------------------------------------
 - ViewBag : are Dynamic Data Types
             has short life, meaning once the data is passed from the controller to the view, it will be set null.
             does not need any typecasting

Eg :  ViewBag.mydata = "Data One";   //declaring a view bag object and setting value

and to access the data in the view page
      @ViewBag.mydata     

 - ViewData : is a Dictionary object that is derived from ViewDataDictionary
              uses key/value pair for storing and retrieving data
              has a short life, (after passing data to the view, becomes null)
              requires typecasting

Eg : ViewData["mydata"] = "Data Two"  //to declare and assign

and to access it in the view

@ViewData["mydata"]



 - TempData : is a Dictionary object that is derived from TempDataDictionary
              uses key/value pair for storing and retrieving data
              internally makes use of session to store data
              to always check for null before using tempdata to avoid runtime errors
              requires typecasting
              has bigger life than viewbag and viewdata
              it is generally used to transfer data from one controller to another

State management of data using tempdata is possible without any additional commands as long as we are in a chain of request. 
if we want the tempdata even on a fresh request, we can get it provided we use TempData.Keep(), that retains the value
