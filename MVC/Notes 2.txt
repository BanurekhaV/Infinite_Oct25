Action Selectors : NonAction - to indicate that an action method is non actionable and hence cannot be invoked, as it does not have an entry in the routing table

ActionName: a provision to map action names with different view name 

Custom Segment Routing : we can change the url routing, and also have many map routes(the first being taken as the default)

Passing Information/Data from the controller to the view
----------------------------------------------------------
 - ViewBag : are Dynamic Data Types
             has short life, meaning once the data is passed from the controller to the view, it will be set null.
             does not need any typecasting

Eg :  ViewBag.mydata = "Data One";   //declaring a view bag object and setting value

and to access the data in the view page
      @ViewBag.mydata     

 - ViewData : is a Dictionary object that is derived from ViewDataDictionary
              uses key/value pair for storing and retrieving data
              has a short life, (after passing data to the view, becomes null)
              requires typecasting

Eg : ViewData["mydata"] = "Data Two"  //to declare and assign

and to access it in the view

@ViewData["mydata"]



 - TempData
