ViewModels : View created out of multiple models


Validations (in-built and custom validation attributes)

ModelState (programmatically controlling validations using Modelstate properties)


Model Binder : is the mechanism which converts the URL segment into method Parameters
- The Parameters can be of primitive type or complex type
- It acts like a bridge between http request and action method and maps the values from the URL which may be as below :

 Model binder uses default Model Binder mapping (rules for mapping)
1. Request.Form[] : if the request is post
2. RouteData.Values[] : if the value is in the route
3. Request.QueryString[] : if the values are concatenated in the url as query string
4. Request.Files[] : If the file is being uploaded

public actionresult GetEmployeedata()
{
  var ID=RouteData.Values["Id"]       (var ID=Request.QueryString["Id"])

Employee emp = emplist.where(e=>e.Id==Convert.ToInt32(ID)).SingleOrDefault();
  return View(emp)
}


Id :     2   Name :    XXX          Age:    26 

int id = Convert.ToInt32(Request.Form["Id"])

posting with model binder

public actionresult SaveData(Employee e)
{

post request

}


When we have to custom bind in situations where the UI controls names are different from Model properties names, we can implement the IModelBinder interface BindModel Method()
  
posting with model binder : sample code

public class EmployeeModel : IModelBinder
{
   public object BindModel(ControllerContext cc, ModelBindingContext mbc)
{
     var obj = cc.HttpContext;
string name = obj.Request.Form["txtname"];
int age = Convert.Toint32(obj.Request.Form["txtage"];

Employee e = new Employee()
{
    Ename = name;
    Eage = age;
};
return e;


Bundling & Minification : is a concept of making use of static files viz .js, .css etc that are required by the application.
- This would be rendered after compressing the resources 
- We can add any resources to the bundle collection of the BundleConfig.cs


Partial Views : are views that are rendered within another view.
- have .cshtml extension like normal views
- are used when we need some common view to be displayed as part of many other views
- are also useful to divide the webpage into smaller portions (header, footer, menus etc..)

To Render a Partial View :

  1. Html.RenderPartial : is a void method

  2. Html.Partial: 
  3. Html.RenderAction : 
  4. Html.Action : 
  5. Jquery Load method
