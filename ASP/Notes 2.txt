Navigation : From one resource to another(within the application or across application, in the same server, or different server)

Response.Redirect : the object transfers to the given resource permanently and ends the processing of he current resource, and the new resource processing continues
- It also sends a command back to the browser(that it has stopped processing of the current resource, leading to unnecessary roundtrip)

Usage : We want the users to understand the url address and resources
        We want to redirect to a new resource as well as a new webserver
        We do not want to preserve the state of the current resource
        We don't mind extra roundtrips


Server.Transfer : helps in navigating between resources of the same application and server
- the original(first) resource is still in the memory that can read the values directly from the new page/resource
- terminates the execution of the current resource and starts executing new resource
- the resource is not redirected permanently

Usage : transfers within the same server
        To preserve server resources and avoid roundtrips to the server
        To preserve the state of the first /previous resource
        To not disclose the url address of all navigating resources

Server.Execute : Similar to transfer except that it does not terminate the execution of previous resource, and Post completion of next resource, returns back to the previous resource


Exceptions : In web forms we can handle exceptions using
   1. Try{} catch {} blocks
   2. Inline code <% %>
   3. Code behind by handling Page_Error() event / per page
   4. Handling Application_Error() event for the entire application
   5. Handling custom errors in the Web.config file
   6. Logging errors onto a file
   7. Logging onto the database
