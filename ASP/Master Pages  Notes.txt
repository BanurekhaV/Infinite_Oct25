Master Pages : Allows us to create page/s with a consistent look and feel for the website including the behaviour (group of pages)

- is a template for the pages that can share the same layout and functionality

- Defines placeholders for the content (content place holder), which can be overridden by the content)
- the output result will be a combination of master page and content page (on request of the content page)
- Can be nested

-Master page is linked to ASP.Net using '@Master' directive


Steps  to create Master Pages :

1. Right click on the project -> add -> newItem->masterpage (second option)
2. Give a name if you wish to change the default name (Site1.master)
3. Remove all the content placeholder tag in both the Head element as well as body element
4. You can have your own design for the master page
5. Now include the content placeholder control by double clicking or dragging it and placing it inside any container element within the body element 
6. You may change the content placeholders id to something that gives an inference to the master viz. primary, main, master etc.
7. Then to format it properly, you may press ctrl k and d
8. Save it
9. Right click on the master page->add contentpage (like this you can add several pages that follow the master page layout)
10. Within the content placeholder tag, you can design your page

Note : we cannot change the layout in the content pages, but only in the master page
