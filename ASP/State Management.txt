State Management : storing/retaining values across pages

can be achieved using techniques as below :
 1. Client Side
    a) ViewState : is a simple dictionary object that stores data as key value pairs
      - does not need any typecasting
      - can store any data including UDT's
      - stores the data at the client side
      - can retain the state across multiple postbacks of the same page
      - cannot travel to other pages


   b) HiddenFields : is a control in the toolbox, which will not be visible at runtime
    - is a class that needs to be intialized along with its members, which can be a load on the system
    - Like viewstate, this also can retain the state across multiple postbacks of the same page
    - cannot travel to other pages
    - can be used if minimal data needs to be stored


   c) Cookies : Allows managing the state across pages
                can travel to other pages with the previous state
                They are of 2 types
                   1. Persistent cookies (uses an object HttpCookies class to store data)
                   2. non-persistent (Data is stored directly in the response object)
