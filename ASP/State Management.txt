State Management : storing/retaining values across pages

can be achieved using techniques as below :
 1. Client Side
    a) ViewState : is a simple dictionary object that stores data as key value pairs
      - does not need any typecasting
      - can store any data including UDT's
      - stores the data at the client side
      - can retain the state across multiple postbacks of the same page
      - cannot travel to other pages


   b) HiddenFields : is a control in the toolbox, which will not be visible at runtime
    - is a class that needs to be intialized along with its members, which can be a load on the system
    - Like viewstate, this also can retain the state across multiple postbacks of the same page
    - cannot travel to other pages
    - can be used if minimal data needs to be stored


   c) Cookies : Allows managing the state across pages
                can travel to other pages with the previous state
                They are of 2 types
                   1. Persistent cookies (uses an object HttpCookies class to store data)
                   2. non-persistent (Data is stored directly in the response object)

   d) Query Strings : allows to manage the state across pages using url
                      we may use url encoding to format data
                      the data is carried from one page to the other on the address bar
                      sensitive data should not be sent via query string

2. Server Side :

   a) Session State : are like viewstate variables that keeps track of the state of a page across others at the server side

   b) Application State : Manages the entire application instance for every session
