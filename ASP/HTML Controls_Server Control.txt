HTML Controls  VS   Server Control
- are meant to serve different purpose

HTML Controls : - are meant to be executed in the browser. They do not posses any server side capabilities by default.
- These do not maintain the state across post backs
- Cannot automatically detect client browser and adapt the behaviour according
- These have very limited set of attributes that can be used to define its behaviour and appearance
- Are simple and straightforward, that they cannot have any logic for abstraction


Server Control : are on the server side and generate the html for the user(browser). They can handle events with more or complex functionality
- These maintain the state across post backs using a mechanism viewstate, allowing the data to be persistent between request. This in turn helps in managing user inputs
- Can detect a client(browser) and according generate html, ensuring compatibility and optimal display
- These have a rich set of properties and methods providing more control over their behaviour and appearance. They support OO Programming principles and can also manipulate from the server side code
- These can provide high level abstraction


In conclusion, html controls are suitable for simple client side interactions, where as asp controls provide more advanced features
