ASP.Net Core :

- is a modern, high performance web development framework for dotnet applications that can run on windows, Linux, macOs , Dockers

LTS : Long Term Support (all even versions of the sdk)

STS - Short/Standard Support (all odd versions of the sdk)

Global.asax - Program.cs (is used to configure applications startup process)

Web.config  - appSettings.json 

HTTP Handlers/Modules - Middleware Components (request pipeline)


.Net Core(Web Application Framework that runs on the .net Core ) vs 

 ASP.Net Core (Is the runtime that supports types of applications like console, desktop, mobile, web, gaming etc..)



Main Method of core does 4 things :

1. Creating the Web Host and configuring services
2. Building the Application
3. Setting Up EndPoints, Routing and Middleware components                  
4. Running the application

CreateBuilder ()
Set up the webserver IIS or Kestrel
Host the application (Inprocess or OutofProcess)
Logging 
Configure the access
Dependency injection Containers

builder.Build()
instance of a webapplication is built, end point setup, configure middleware and start handling request

Run () - keeps running the application till we manually close the server instance

Hosting : Refers to services that allow web applications to be accessed over the internet

2 models are available 
  1. Inprocess - Aspnet core appln. runs inside the IIS Worker Process (w3wp.exe) - default hosting model
  2. OutOfprocess  -- separate worker process (mostly kestrel) ( In this type of hosting, The webservers act as a reverse proxy that forwards the incoming http request to an internal webserver (kestrel)



MiddleWare : basic building blocks of the request Pipeline viz. authentication, authorization, error handling, routing, logging etc

We need to configure middlewares in the order, that needs to be executed by adding them to the Main()


MapGet : are extension methods used for defining endpoint middleware and mapping incoming http request to a specific middleware
  - designed only for GET request. responds only to get

Map : is a generic method for all types of http request(get,post,put,delete)


Use : extension method to run the middlewares in the pipeline

Run : a terminal middleware used to stop any more executions 

wwwroot folder : where static files are stored and served to the client (like css, html.javascripts, images, etc.).

If we wish to change the name of the webroot folder, then we have to specify the property settings using WebApplicationOptions class instance
