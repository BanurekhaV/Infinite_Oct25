S/w engg principles :
 1. Separation of concerns
 2. Modularization
 3. Abstractions (what rather than how)
 4. Anticipation of Changes
     - Generality (de-coupled code)
     - Incremental Development
     - Consistency 
 5. DRY - Do not repeat yourselves
 6. KISS - Keep it Simple Stupid
 7. YAGNI - You Aren't Gonna need it. (Avoid features/functions that are not required)
 8. SOLID : are design principles

D Dependency Inversion Principle : High level modules/classes (consumers/clients) should not depend on low level class/modules(implementing classes). Both should depend on an Abstraction


client class  -  dependent
service class -  dependency
injector class -  an Ioc which injects the dependency object into any 3 locations of the dependent object
  1. constructor, 2. ActionMethod, 3. Properties
