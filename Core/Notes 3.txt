S/w engg principles :
 1. Separation of concerns
 2. Modularization
 3. Abstractions (what rather than how)
 4. Anticipation of Changes
     - Generality (de-coupled code)
     - Incremental Development
     - Consistency 
 5. DRY - Do not repeat yourselves
 6. KISS - Keep it Simple Stupid
 7. YAGNI - You Aren't Gonna need it. (Avoid features/functions that are not required)
 8. SOLID : are design principles

S  - SRP
O  - OCP
L  - LSP
I  - 
D Dependency Inversion Principle : High level modules/classes (consumers/clients) should not depend on low level class/modules(implementing classes). Both should depend on an Abstraction


client class  -  dependent
service class -  dependency
injector class -  an Ioc which injects the dependency object into any 3 locations of the dependent object
  1. constructor, 2. ActionMethod, 3. Properties

EF Core Code First

2. Code First Approach :

-Create an MVC application
-Add Model class/es to the models folder
-Add a Connection string in appsettings.json file
-Create a Context Class and make an entry of the model classes
-Register the DbContext class along with Sqlservices in the program.cs file
-Build once
-in the PM Console, migrate using
   Add-Migration "<name>"
   Update-database
Then you can create respective controllers and perform actions

3. Routing

4. Binding without Model

IFormCollection : Keys, ContainsKey, TryGetvalue(key, out value)


Tag Helpers : <input asp-for="Empid" class="form-control />

@Html.TesxtBoxFor(m=> m.Empid, new{@ class = "form-control"})
