Monolith Era : UI, Business Logic, Data Access - lived as a single unit. Easy to develop, test, and deploy

  - Tight Coupling 
  - Scaling
  - Deployment

Distributed Application Evolution : Divide and Conquer (Microservices), an architectural shift promising agility, scalability, resilience, easy deploy ability etc..

 - RPC - remote procedure calls
 - DCOM - Distributed component Object Model
 - Webservices
 - WCF - Windows Communication Framework 
 - RESTful APIs

Revolutionary Challenges of 
Service Discovery
State management
Inter Service communication
Monitoring and support


Common Problems of distributed System
- Network Partitions
- Replication and consistency
- Fault Tolerance
- Concurrency and Coordination 
- scalability and Load balancing 


Web Services : Is a software service that makes use of XML for data exchange and messaging. Uses SOAP(Simple Object Access Protocol) protocol for communication, with the servers that have some services written

A web service is a set of open protocols and standards that allow data to be exchanged between different applications or systems. Web services can be used by software programs written in different programming languages and running on a variety of platform via computer networks

- are language, platform and protocol independent
- includes
  a) XML
  b) SOAP
  c) WSDL ( Web Service Description Language)
  d) UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration) - helps in searching for a particular service (registered) over the net

webservice application has an extension .asmx

Functions of Web Services :
 
Its is possible to access webservices via the internet and intranet networks
Built using XML messaging that is standardised
Operating System and Language independent
Self describing
Uses simple location approach to locate a service
